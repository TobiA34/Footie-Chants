#### MVVM
MVVM is an architecture pattern that allows you to seperate the interface of an app, it has the development of the business logic which is the model. In this app, I use MVVM to seperate the functions which perform actions in their class.
 
 ---
#### Dark Mode
Dark mode is used to change the interface of an app to light or dark. I use dark mode in my app when the user selects light or dark in the setting then the UI element will change depending on what theme has been selected.
